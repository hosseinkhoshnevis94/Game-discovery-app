**Repository Name**: Game Discovery App

**Description**:

Welcome to the Game Project repository! This project is a web application built with React and several powerful libraries and tools, including Vite, React Router DOM, Chakra UI, Zustand, and React Query. It provides a platform for users to explore and discover games.

**Features**:

1. **Homepage**: The project includes a homepage with a user-friendly navbar that allows users to search for games. The navbar is designed with Chakra UI for a modern and responsive look.

2. **Game List**: On the homepage, users can view a list of games. React Query is used to efficiently fetch and display game data. Each game card provides a brief overview of the game.

3. **Sidebar**: The sidebar on the homepage categorizes games by genre. Users can click on different genres to filter and explore games within specific categories.

4. **Game Detail Page**: When users click on a game card, they are navigated to a dedicated game detail page. Here, they can access more detailed information about the selected game, including descriptions, reviews, and screenshots.

5. **State Management**: Zustand is used for state management within the application, providing a predictable and efficient way to manage application state.

**Tech Stack**:

- React for building the user interface.
